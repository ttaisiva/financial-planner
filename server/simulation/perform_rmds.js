// Perform the RMD for the previous year, if the user’s age is at least 74 and at the end of the previous
// year, there is at least one investment with tax status = “pre-tax” and with a positive value.
// a. The first RMD is for the year in which the user turns 73, and is paid in the year in which the user
// turns 74.
// b. Distribution period d = result from lookup of the user’s age in the most recent available RMD table
// (typically the current actual year’s RMD table).
// c. s = sum of values of the investments with tax status = pre-tax, as of the end of the previous year.
// (don’t look for “IRA” in the name of the investment type. employer-sponsored pre-tax retirement
// accounts are not IRAs.)
// d. rmd = s / d
// e. curYearIncome += rmd
// f. Iterate over the investments in the RMD strategy in the given order, transferring each of them in-
// kind to an investment with the same investment type and with tax status = “non-retirement”, until
// the total amount transferred equals rmd. The last investment to be transferred might be partially
// transferred.
// g. “Transferring in-kind” means reducing the value of the source investment by the transferred
// amount, checking whether an investment with the same investment type and target tax status
// already exists, and if so, adding the transferred amount to its value, otherwise creating an
// investment with the same investment type, the target tax status, and value equal to the transferred amount.
